  <p class="text-muted">Music is a vital part of education here at Velammal Vidhyashram and we ensure that students get an opportunity to play and enjoy all forms of music. Velammal Vidhyashram has two Music Rooms that house instruments that students can play during music classes or club classes. The Music room is used as a place for students to practice and play their preferred instruments. Students who choose to be part of the Music Club may also bring their own instruments. Our instruments include a complete drum kit, keyboards, and guitars (both acoustic and electric), among others.

    Music is integrated into the curriculum from the kindergarten years so that children develop a love for it. In the early years, children are made aware of rhythm and melody through group singing of songs and rhymes. Our music rooms fitted with state-of-the-art instruments and run by professionally-trained and qualified music teachers, provide the perfect environment for children to learn and appreciate music. Children in the younger grades have Western Music classes incorporated into their daily schedules, allowing them to unwind and express themselves in the most creative way possible! Students in Middle and High School get the opportunity to continue their musical training, if they choose, by becoming part of the Velammal Vidhyashram Music Club.
    
    The Music Club classes include training in vocals and instruments. Our fully-equipped music rooms allow students to explore and learn to lay western instruments such as drums, guitar, keyboard, etc. as well as Indian instruments such as tabla, dholak, daphli, etc. The classes are designed to facilitate learning for all students who become members at their level.</p>
